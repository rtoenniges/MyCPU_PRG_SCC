# Hardware
## External module (Basic board without DCF77-Input)
This board only generates the alternating current to drive the clock.

## Rack Extension (DCF77-Input and slave-clock control)
This board is connected directly to the MyCPU-Backplane Bus.

It provides support to connect an DCF77-Receiver and generates the alternating
current to drive the clock. 

Also it displays the status of the time synchronization and the active clock output.
